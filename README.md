UI:

## Tech Stack

- ReactJS

- Chakra UI

- NodeJs

Bonus Points (in descending order of value):

- Local nodejs server is used to prefetch the required data from the open public api

Frontend calls an endpoint from the nodejs server to retrieve data

Data is prefetched every n minutes

Use a React UI Component library 

Extra points if "PrimeReact" is used

Details should persist of page refresh

UI should be a single page UI with all components accessible at all times

UI should be optimized for laptop screens (1024px minimum)

Bonus if optimized for mobile screens (425px)

Display interesting stats (highest value compared to USD, current INR vs USD value, etc.)
